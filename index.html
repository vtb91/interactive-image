    <h1> How race and class influences treatment for opioid addiction in New York City</h1>
    <h2> By: Chris Hickey and Violetta Torres-Barón </h2>
    <br>
    <P class="main-text">
      If you’re addicted to opioids and you want to get help, where do you turn? How do you get treated? In New York City, as elsewhere in the United States, you basically have two options for a medication-assisted detox: methadone and buprenorphine. But ever since both medications have been available, they’ve been distributed unequally. In fact, research has shown that race, class, income and insurance status can largely determine which of these two drugs a patient has access to.

    </P>

    <P class="main-text">
      This dynamic has led to disparities within New York City and elsewhere for those seeking opioid addiction treatment. In Staten Island, where the population is majority white, there is a higher rate of buprenorphine prescriptions than in the Bronx, where the population is predominantly black and Latino. In 2016, the Bronx had a higher rate of patients enrolled in a methadone maintenance program than any other borough.

      Both medications are used to lower dependence from heroin and prescription opioids. But a patient is less likely to overdose on buprenorphine than on methadone. And with buprenorphine (the most common formulation being Suboxone), a patient can get a prescription refill for up to three months. A patient starting out in a methadone treatment program, on the other hand, has to visit a clinic nearly everyday for a dose.
    </P>

    <P class="main-text">
      Methadone has been available since the 1960’s and was approved federally amid former President Richard Nixon’s “War on Drugs,” according to Helena Hansen, a psychiatrist and cultural anthropologist at New York University’s Langone Medical Center who studies race and addiction. Hansen says that from its introduction, methadone was associated with urban, black and brown heroin users in high-crime areas of the country.
    </P>

    <P class="main-text">
      Hansen argues the stigma around methadone hasn’t shaken. Clinics are heavily regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration and typically exist at a remove from other medical and clinical settings.
    </P>

    <P class="main-text">
      “Methadone clinics were located in basically in kind of marginal neighborhoods where people aren't organized enough to protest. So methadone had its racial image, its class image, in its history,” she says.
    </P>

    <P class="main-text">
      Hansen identifies multiple cultural, economic and political factors that have led to the disparity between buprenorphine and methadone.

      From it’s introduction in the early 2000’s, Hansen argues, buprenorphine, was marketed as a treatment for whiter, suburban, prescription opioid-abusing patients. As a patented drug, it was a more expensive than methadone and federal law only allowed it to be prescribed by physicians who had received eight hours of extra training. According to Hansen, these factors have discouraged many public sector doctors from prescribing the drug to their patients, a higher proportion of whom are low-income, underinsured and marginalized.

      “Public sector doctors, they don't have any financial incentive to take on buprenorphine patients,” Hansen says. “They're super busy. They have huge caseloads. The last thing they really need is a bunch of--in their minds--extra and complicated patients and then carve out eight hours of time to do an additional training.”
